            <br />We, the four computer science students of the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, under the supervision of Prof.
            Paul-Christian Volkmer, worked together on this project that will help students especially
            during the time of Global Pandemic.
            <br />
            <br />We are facing difficult times and the Covid-19 Pandemic has brought us many challenges.
            Social distancing has quarantined people to work from home and students to attend classes via the internet.
            <br />
            <br />The aim of this project is to give the students and members of the THM family
            a platform where they could post their concerns, ask questions
            and give answers and comments to other students' questions even during lockdown.
            <br />
            <br />The Goal is to create a community, an online campus, where we could still
            communicate with each other, THM Students and Professors, and help each other get through this trying times.
            <br />
            <br />We are hoping that this project will contribute and continue to contribute
            for the betterment of the online experience of the THM community even after the Pandemic.
